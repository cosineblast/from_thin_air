# `from thin_air` challenge

This is a small challenge intended to teach you on how to
adapting existing algorithms into new ones.

The main goal is to exercise the programmer's ability to answer the following question:

"How would I solve this problem if someone had already solved part of it for me"

In this challenge, you will be solving a variety of exercises, which consist of
implementing functions to solve simple tasks, such as sorting lists, or computing
list sums.

However, there's a catch! To pass this challenge, your solutions must use the aid of a
an existing helper function `solve` that can solve this same problem for you,
and you always have to use `solve` with an argument that is less than the one your function received
(in other words, you can't cheat by calling `solve` on the original input itself).

This skills can be really useful for developing new algorithms to solve problems, when combined
with other concepts that are typically [more scary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion).
